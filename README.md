Microsoft Home Page Clone with Dark Background
In this project, I have created a Microsoft Home Page clone which have a dark background instead of the traditional ones. As well as a project to tribute Robert Downey Junior for his splendid work in the entertainment industry.
These projects are created by using HTML and CSS is used for some styling in the webpage.
