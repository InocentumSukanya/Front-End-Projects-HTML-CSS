Microsoft Home Page Clone with Dark Background
In this project, I have created a Microsoft Home Page clone which have a dark background instead of the traditional ones. As well as a project to tribute Robert Downey Junior for his splendid work in the entertainment industry.
The Microsoft Home Page can be used as a base page for many different sites as it contains all the details that are present in the original website page of microsoft.
These projects are created by using HTML and CSS is used for some styling in the webpage. As both of these are the basic set of technologies that are used for this kind of work.
